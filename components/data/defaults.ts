This creates a barrier that is difficult for animals to penetrate. Pet screens are available in a variety of specifications, depending on the intended use. For example, some types of pet screens are coated with vinyl to resist UV damage. Others are treated with chemicals that deter animals from chewing or clawing at the material. When selecting a pet screen for a particular application, it is important to consider the size and strength of the animal as well as the intended use of the product. The pet screen is also great for use on pool cages as it will allow you to see your pet while they are swimming and keep them safe from other animals that may be in the area.
